This is some brief and not-impressive fiddling with the data set forked from the [Twin Cities R User Group repo](https://github.com/tcrug/car-reliability). Some simple plots to take a look at used car reliability data for for models:

*Model year vs. issue rate*

*Vehicle mileage vs. issue rate*

*Per model year mileage of trade in vs. distribution for the whole dataset*
